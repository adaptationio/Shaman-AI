# Shaman-AI
Deep Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Genetic Algorithm and Optimization all in one solutions 

## Introduction
Everything you need to start and finish a AI RL project from idea to production ( Will upadte this more one I have had a couple of coffee :)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Python 3.6 or higher (https://www.anaconda.com/download) or (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- Optional but recommended Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.
    Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.
    - __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name shaman-ai python=3.6
	source activate shaman-ai
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name shaman-ai python=3.6 
	activate shaman-ai
	```
- Install tensorflow:
    ```bash
    conda install tensorflow-gpu
	or
	conda install tensorflow
	```

- Install requirements:
    ```bash
    conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
	```
# Tensorflow CPU
conda env create -f conda-cpu.yml
conda activate shaman-ai-cpu

# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate shaman-ai-gpu
## Instructions

- Run:
    ```bash
	python .
	```

## OpenCV fixes
conda install -c conda-forge opencv=4.3.0
sudo apt-get install libopencv-*
